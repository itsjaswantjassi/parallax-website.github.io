        <h2>TANJIRO KAMADO</h2>
        <p>Tanjiro is a young boy of average height with fairly tanned skin and an athletic, muscular physique. He has
            ruffled, black hair with burgundy tips, combed back to expose his forehead, and wide, dark red eyes with
            white pupils that appear lighter around the lower section of his irises. He also has a scar on the top left
            of his forehead, first seen when his mother brought him to watch his father perform the Hinokami Kagura
            dance. The scar originally looked somewhat like a graze until his fight with the Hand Demon during the Final
            Selection, after which it develops into a flame-like pattern as his Demon Slayer Mark. It is noted that his
            hands are visibly rougher for someone his age, as a result of his rigorous training under Sakonji Urokodaki.
            Tanjiro looks remarkably similar in appearance to his ancestor Sumiyoshi, possessing the same facial
            structure, eyes, and hairstyle as him, although Sumiyoshi's hair was longer, about shoulder-length and would
            be tied in a ponytail behind his head.</p>

        <h2>ZENITSU</h2>
        <p>Zenitsu is a young boy of average height with fair skin and downward-sloped, scared-looking eyes that fade
            from soft brown to gold. He has short, yellow hair of varying lengths, cutting off squarely at the ends
            where it fades to a darker orange color, that falls in front of his face in uneven bangs, loosely resembling
            a bowl cut. Before he became a Demon Slayer, Zenitsu's hair was originally black, but it turned the color it
            is currently when he was struck by lightning during his training.[2]

            For some time following the battle at Mount Natagumo, his limbs temporarily shrunk due to the Spider Demon
            (Son)'s poison but were able to return to normal afterward thanks to the medicine given to him by Shinobu
            Kocho.[4]

            He wears a paler brown version of the standard Demon Slayer uniform, which consists of a dark brown gakuran
            jacket, a white belt around his waist and hakama pants that extend, as well as his signature white-triangle
            patterned, yellow and orange gradient haori. As well as this, Zenitsu also sports a pair of Kyahan, tied at
            the front in 3 white bows, with the same pattern as his haori, pale brown tabi socks and white-laced zōri.

        <h2>INOSUKE</h2>
        <p>nosuke is a young man of average height and pale complexion with an extremely toned and muscular build for
            his age, possessing large, defined muscles most notably over his stomach and arms. In sharp contrast to
            this, he has an incredibly pretty and feminine face,[3] with large, wide eyes that are framed by an array of
            long eyelashes, their irises a dark to soft pale green, thin eyebrows and what could be a small,
            well-mannered mouth. His thick, black hair reaches just past his shoulders, fading into blue at the tips and
            forming an unruly and uneven fringe that falls just above his eyes, puffing out before curving and thinning
            towards his forehead.

            Inosuke wears his altered version of the standard Demon Slayer uniform, which consists only of the baggy
            hakama pants, his tinted a dark gray-blue, which he fastens around his hips with a thick belt of fluffy
            brown deer fur.[4] Unlike his travelling companions, Inosuke does not wear a haori. The usual cloth
            leg-wraps are replaced with what appears to be knee-high socks of bear hide[4] which expose his heels and
            toes, which also appear to be what fastens the sandal-bases he wears on his feet. His most defining feature
            is the gray, hollowed-out boar's head he wears as to mask his own, the eyes of which he has tampered with to
            allow himself vision while wearing it,[5] which has been revealed to have belonged to his late adoptive boar
            mother.</p>

                NEZUKO KAMADO

    <section class=" section info5">
        <h2>NEZUKO KAMADO</h2>
        <p>Nezuko is a petite young girl with fair skin, visibly large, prominent fangs, and sharp, stiletto nails with
            a base color of light pink and ombre fading to a red-pinkish color at the end where they point. Her hair is
            long, black, and wavy. It reaches just below her waist, turning a flame-orange color as it passes her
            elbows, and appears to be crimped into large, straight ridges, worn side-swept drastically to her left. She
            has soft-looking, pale pink eyes that appear a lighter color around the rims of their irises, slanted
            downward toward the sides of her face and framed by notably long eyelashes, the pupils of which can appear
            slit as she transforms. In the manga, Nezuko can sometimes be shown with more than one bow. According to
            Tanjiro Kamado, Nezuko was known as a great beauty in their home town.[4]

            She wears a light pink kimono with an asanoha (hemp leaf) pattern, the lining a paler pink, secured by a red
            and white-checkered hanhaba obi with an orange-threaded obijime and a green obiage. Over this, she sports a
            long, dark-brown haori that reaches her calves, as well as a pair of zōri with pink straps and white tabi
            socks, wrapped with thick pieces of black material resembling kyahan. Nezuko also wears a small pink ribbon
            on the left side of her head to keep her hair out of her face, along with the bamboo muzzle Giyu Tomioka
            gave her,[5] which is secured around her jaw with a strip of red cloth.

            When Nezuko transforms into her awakened form during her fight with Daki, she has a bigger, taller and
            curvaceous body and has longer hair that reaches to her feet. She loses her bamboo muzzle and footwear, as
            well as the sleeves of her haori and kimono. She grows a short white horn on the right side of her forehead
            designed with irregular crack pattern, along with vein-like patterns in her forehead near her horn. She has
            vein-like pattern appears around her left eye, but her most striking new feature is the red and green
            vine-like pattern that covers her skin, circling around her arms, legs, and chest.

            As a human, she had a very similar appearance, the only differences being her lack of demon-like traits,
            vermilion hair, and pale pink eyes. Instead, Nezuko had fully black hair, worn tied back in three low buns,
            decorated by pink ribbons, and eyes of a dark red color that only appeared pale pink around their lower
            irises. She wore the same kimono, just without her haori and with a white Onbuhimo cloth tied around her,
            which she used to carry her little brother, Rokuta Kamado, on her back.[6]
